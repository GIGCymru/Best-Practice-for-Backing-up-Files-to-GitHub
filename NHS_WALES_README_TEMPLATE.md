### Code Review Process
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Make changes and commit with clear messages
3. Create pull request to `develop`
4. **Required:** 2 approvals from team members
5. **Required:** Security review for sensitive changes
6. Merge after all checks pass

## Security Considerations

### ⚠️ Important Security Notes
- **NO patient data** should ever be committed to this repository
- **NO production credentials** should be stored in code
- Use Azure Key Vault for all secrets and connection strings
- All database scripts must be reviewed for data privacy compliance

### Data Classification
